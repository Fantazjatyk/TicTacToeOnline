# Tic Tac Toe Game Implementation
## Demo
Working demo is available at webiste www.tictactoe.michal-szymanski.pl (currently, only multiplayer mode).

If You want to play in multiplayer mode with another player, You could just stay on "players matcher" page ("http://tictactoe.michal-szymanski.pl/menu/multiplayer/join/play_searcher"), and - in meantime - send a direct link to "players matcher" page to second player, and when he will open it, the game should start immediately. 
**However - If game not started properly, just start it again, and everything will work properly.**

**NOTE: If You want to play in multiplayer mode on one computer only, You can do this this using different web browsers. For example with Google Chrome and Opera.**

_Have fun._
